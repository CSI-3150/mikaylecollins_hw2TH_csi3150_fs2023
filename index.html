      <h3>About Me!</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Mikayle Collins, I am a senior at Oakland University
        majoring in Computer Science. I currently work at Stellantis as a
        controls engineer. I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience with
        the interworking of a multi-gear transmission, torque paths, MATLAB, and
        strategic operations involving battery charge and torque. While working
        at Stellantis, I have utilized an Agile Scrum approach to work through
        IBM's program ALM. In addition, I am a part of the PReP program at
        Oakland University. This program is through Stellantis and OU.
        Stellantis professionals come weekly to teach us the powertrain of the
        vehicles. That being said, I have a mechanical background in addition to
        my current major. Before working at Stellantis, I had an internship at a
        top tier supplier, Borgwarner. At Borgwarner, I worked in IT mobility
        handling over 2000+ users in North America. Now that you know more about
        my professional background, to see my resume and fun facts about me
